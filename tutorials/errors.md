<!--

To future writer/updater:

Customer app should register for the 'CITRIX_DISCONNECTED' event.

This event signifies that the Citrix session has disconnected, or CWP has encountered an unrecoverable error. The app should end any active calls and unsubscribe the user.

Later, when the customer app has re-initialized following a Citrix session reconnect, CWP should be initialized again
